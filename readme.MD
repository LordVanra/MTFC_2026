# IDENTIFY THE TOPIC

We are exploring the impact of autonomous vehicles (AVs) on local carbon emissions and traffic patterns. Over the past few years, the field of computer vision and autonomous systems has been gaining prevalence, making larger scale AV systems possible. Based on their current development and environmentally sustainable nature, it is projected that by the year 2040, AVs will make up around 75% of all vehicles on the road. This will mostly affect people living in urban areas who experience a large amount of traffic congestion. Moreover, this adjustment will decrease the dependency on unreliable human drivers and limit the necessity for third-party roadside services.

# IDENTIFY POTENTIAL RISKS

On the individual level, pollution poses serious health risks leading to headaches and coughing, as well as respiratory illnesses and neurological impediments. Certain industries, especially in the healthcare sector, face significant risk due to pollution as it leads to higher expenditure on procedures that are becoming increasingly necessary. The government also suffers from pollution as they have to spend more money on maintaining crucial resources, such as water and clean air. The best possible scenario is the natural reduction of pollution and a cleaner world without significant expenses. The worst case scenario is world-wide pollution which leads to natural resources and current architecture becoming unusable.

# IDENTIFY A BEHAVIOR CHANGE RISK MITIGATION STRATEGY

One strategy that could be used to reduce risk is to increase the sale of autonomous vehicles in urban areas, leading to a higher average fuel efficiency, consequentially decreasing the amount of pollution. The government would provide an initial investment for new vehicles, but the reduction in infrastructure damage and decrease in pollution related illnesses would offset the costs.

# IDENTIFY A MODIFYING OUTCOMES RISK MITIGATION STRATEGY

Autonomous vehicles can directly decrease the total amount of carbon emissions in the atmosphere by being more fuel efficient. Their ability to reduce the amount of fuel expended would minimise the effects of pollution in a given area, impacting the local community and landscape on a societal level.

# IDENTIFY AN INSURANCE RISK MITIGATION STRATEGY

Insurance companies could offer specialized AV insurance policies to cover autonomous system failures, and human and AV accident responsibility. This protects individuals from financial losses whilst also providing data on AV related claims to governments, distributing the risk equally between individuals and government

# IDENTIFY DRIVING RESEARCH QUESTIONS FOR YOUR TOPIC

What are the long term projections for changes in air, water, and soil quality in cities around the US, and how would these projections change different percentages of AV density within cities and roads?
What is the percentage of people who experience severe respiratory and neurological conditions that live in high pollution risk areas?
How effective are the use of autonomous vehicles in reducing pollution in urban areas?

# IDENTIFY THE TYPE OF DATA YOU HOPE TO FIND

An ideal dataset would include data about the amount of greenhouse gas emissions and resource efficiency of autonomous vehicles compared to electric and gas-powered vehicles. Additionally, a dataset including how many crashes occur over a certain period of time, the type of services needed to address the issue, and their greenhouse gas emissions would help us estimate a crash rate and their effects. Lastly, data about the costs of owning an AV and costs of government programs to mitigate the impact of greenhouse gasses would be essential to calculate the return on investment when purchasing an AV.

# IDENTIFY POTENTIAL DATA SOURCES FOR YOUR TOPIC

https://www.nhtsa.gov/nhtsa-datasets-and-apis

These datasets are produced by the US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, a federal agency under the US Department of Transportation, making it a highly credible external publicly available dataset. This dataset covers both categorized risks and potential outcomes, as it discusses the types and categories of data that define historical frequency, as it provides numbers for annual crashes, fatalities, and injuries.

Using the data, we could create crash frequency tables, severity distributions, urban vs. rural crash comparisons, and time series plots of AV related accidents. These tables would allow us to focus on the impact of AVs on accident rates.

This dataset was produced by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, a federal agency considered with how external factors, such as AV’s, affect the environment. This dataset helps categorize risks and potential outcomes, since it talks about how simulations were used to find changes in environmental factors and risks/outcomes for this project. 

Using this data, we could compare emissions, fuel use by simulation types alongside energy production mixes and efficiency improvements. This would allow us to create bar graphs (emissions by scenario) and line charts (emissions over time) to help illustrate our central point.

Waymo, a leading AV manufacturing company, has provided several datasets which include multimodal and synchronised sensor data from cameras, LiDAR, maps, and trajectory data. This data has been collected across many cities and weather conditions with carefully annotated 2D and 3D labels.

Because of their size, we can use these datasets to create traffic-scene heatmaps, distribution charts of obstacle occurrences to see how often potential crashes occur, and analyses of certain interactions, such as stopping at pedestrian crossings or lane changes. The frequency at which frames are captured in the Waymo datasets is very high, so this data will allow us to come to strong conclusions after analysis. 

# MODELING RESEARCH ON YOUR TOPIC

Search results yielded several academic peer-reviewed papers and modeling frameworks. For example, one model explored traffic flow simulation with energy/emission prediction models to analyse how varying levels of AV adoption affect congestion, fuel consumption, crash rates, and environmental impact. These papers were helpful as they showed us how simulation models such as system dynamics, Monte Carlo crash modeling, and agent based traffic models are able to estimate AV impacts on both safety and emissions. Certain techniques like differential equation traffic models and multivariate risk optimization were more advanced examples of strong models that could be used as inspiration for our own model.

# GOALS OF A MATHEMATICAL MODEL IN THE PROJECT PHASE

A mathematical model should be able to calculate the impact on the environment through the costs of mitigating the impact. This means that the model should be able to compare the costs of only using autonomous vehicles, only using gas powered vehicles, only using electric vehicles, and using a combination of both gas and electric vehicles on the road. To identify the risk over time, we can use the model to see the environmental impact due to the greenhouse gas emissions and compare that with the costs of reversing the impact. We hope to use a comparative scenario analysis to analyze the different emissions of vehicles and identify the return on investment for each type of vehicle. Additionally, we will analyze the effects of crash rates on emissions, by comparing probability and severity change under different vehicle mixes. 


# ASSUMPTION DEVELOPMENT

The appropriate time period is from now to 2050, which is when autonomous vehicles are predicted to be a majority of the vehicles on the road. This means that we can measure the impact of the current vehicles and model the transition to measure the environmental and financial impact.

https://www.weforum.org/stories/2025/05/autonomous-vehicles-technology-future/

How do you expect your data to change over that time period? Will the rate of change be the same or different from the historical rate of change or trend? What leads you to consider this a rational and logical assumption?

We expect the number of autonomous vehicles to increase and hence, the environmental impacts to potentially decrease. With the mitigation actions provided, the rate of change for the greenhouse gas emissions will decrease from the historical trend, as a critical factor resulting in climate change will decrease. 

# GOALS FOR MITIGATION STRATEGY

Because of rising greenhouse gas levels in the atmosphere, the current trajectory of climate change will lead to environmental destruction and increase many risks to safety, such as an increase in the amount of cardiovascular and neurological diseases. It would also mean that car crashes continue to claim many lives each year, with human error still affecting driving conditions. With the risk mitigation strategy, the goal would be for more individuals to purchase autonomous vehicles due to the advantages they are receiving. 

# RECOMMENDATION DIFFERENCES BETWEEN MITIGATION STRATEGIES

To measure health risk, we can look at the city’s hospitalization rate as an increase in pollution would result in more sick people. For crashes (cost), we can just look at the annual crash rate. The strategy we will use in our project will be modifying outcomes, as providing AVs is predicted to lower risk. 

# AUDIENCE FOR RECOMMENDATIONS

A possible target audience are vehicle owners with gas vehicles who have to switch electric vehicles due to gas car bans. These customers will be inclined to buy autonomous, electric vehicles when provided with reasonable prices or other benefits compared to normal electric vehicles. 

# GOALS FOR SITUATION IMPROVEMENT

We hope the recommendations decrease the carbon emissions produced by the automobile industry as buyers will obtain electric, autonomous vehicles instead of inefficient gas powered vehicles. The addition of autonomous vehicles will also decrease the amount of crashes on the road, which will subsequently decrease the carbon emission on the road. Construction companies, towing businesses, and other groups will have to arrive at the scene and use resources to mend the situation, leading to more carbon emissions. With more autonomous vehicles on the road, the time for travel will decrease as well, leading to less emission by all vehicles. Overall, carbon emissions by automobiles will decrease to prevent further climate change, natural disasters, and harmful fumes for individuals.
